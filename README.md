![storey range 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d8f88e-56af-491a-9ef7-3220b20ba80d)

This chart shows that the average resale price and floor area of flats vary based on storey range and flat type. Flats located in the mid-storey ranges tend to have higher resale prices, with 5-room, executive, and multi-generation flats being the most valuable. The average floor area of flats tends to be larger in the mid-storey ranges and decreases in the higher storeys. Overall, mid-storey flats, particularly those with more rooms, are more desirable due to their combination of higher resale values and larger living spaces.

![storey range 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ceb1e9-b407-4a03-963f-b8dcaab90015)

The chart on the left indicates that multi-generation flats have the highest average resale prices, followed by executive and 5-room flats, with 1-room flats having the lowest resale prices, supporting the previous chart. In contrast, the chart on the right reveals that 4-room flats make up 40% of the total resale market, while multi-generation flats account for less than 1%, and executive flats represent only 11%. This suggests that the market is more concentrated in the mid-price range, with a higher volume of sales occurring for 4-room flats.

## <a name ="town-location"></a>Town location 

![Town](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d56b1b38-407c-437f-b393-6d5ac649d01e)

This visual data shows a variation in the housing resale market across different towns. The map shows the average resale price for flats in each town, represented by bubble sizes. Towns such as Bukit Merah, Queenstown, and Bishan have larger bubbles, indicating higher average resale prices, while towns like Jurong West, Sengkang, and Yishun have smaller bubbles, signifying lower average resale prices.

The bar chart highlights the total resale prices by town, with Sengkang, Tampines, and Jurong West showing the highest total resale values. This suggests that these towns have a higher volume of transactions, even though their average resale prices are not the highest. On the other hand, towns like Bukit Timah, Marine Parade, and Central Area have the lowest total resale prices, indicating fewer transactions. 

Overall, the data suggests that while some towns have higher average resale prices, the majority of the market activity is concentrated in areas with mid-range prices, reflecting a diverse housing market with different levels of demand and property values across Singapore.

![Over the years](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1046f006-2f09-469a-9c48-10e35e010a82)

This charts provide a comprehensive view of the resale property market trends. The total resale prices have generally increased over this period, despite some fluctuations. A noticeable rise occurred in 2016 and 2017, followed by a slight dip in 2018 and then a sharp increase in 2019, indicating a growing market in terms of total value.

In contrast, the average resale price has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations. There was a slight increase in 2018, but this was followed by a decrease in 2019. This suggests that while more properties may have been sold, or higher-value properties contributed to the total increase, the average price has not seen a significant long-term rise.

The relationship between resale price and remaining lease years reveals that properties with around 50 remaining lease years tend to have the highest average resale prices. Properties with significantly fewer lease years are less valuable, while those with too many remaining years also see a dip in average price, possibly due to a different buyer perception or market demand dynamics. 

Overall, the market shows resilience and growth in total value, while the average price remain stable and its relationship with lease years shows that longer lease is prefered.

## <a name ="Key-influencers-generated-by-PowerBi"></a>Key influencers generated by PowerBi

The key influencer graph highlights factors that significantly impact the average resale price of properties. The analysis shows that the flat model and storey range are critical determinants of resale value. 

### Flat model

![Key Influence 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be277753-0af2-4a6c-af2e-4d305dad40a4)

The bar chart provides a comparative analysis of different flat models, illustrating that "Type S1" flats significantly exceed the average resale price of other flat models, followed by "Type S2". This suggests that flat model plays a significant role in determining property values in the resale market.

### Storey range

![Key Influence 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/325170c0-aa2b-4a9b-bed5-38b51f8e55a6)

This bar chart shows that average resale price increases significantly when the "storey_range" is between 37 and 39 compared to other ranges, and prices gradually increase going up the range. This indicates that as the storey level goes higher, the average price of resale is more likely to increase. Despite lower floors having larger area and more rooms as shown in [Storey range & Flat type](#storey-range-&-flat-type) , the average price seems to be lower like due to smaller percentage of it being the larger apartments as such it is overshadowed.

### Flat type

![Key Influence 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4535af0c-bc8e-4a0e-9ae2-4b74322afeb5)

The provided chart reveals that the primary factor influencing a decrease in average resale prices is the "flat_type", specifically 2-room units. These units exhibit a significant price reduction, nearly halving the average price compared to larger units. While other factors such as "flat_model" and "Year" are also relevant, their impact on resale prices is less pronounced.

## <a name ="Top-segments-generated-by-PowerBi"></a>Top segments generated by PowerBi

Top Segments in the Key Influencers visual identifies and displays the most significant subgroups or categories that drive a particular outcome or metric. For this data, all top 5 segments points to floor_area_sqm. 

![Top Segment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296747e2-b6dd-454e-aaab-a427b6e738f4)
![Top Segment 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c19021-7387-431b-816f-dff207a9f04c)
![Top Segment 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fa1da23-20cc-49a0-9309-49e91e90ac32)
![Top Segment 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/575a3d4d-9078-4d05-9aed-581c035dacc5)

The Top segments reveals that larger floor areas and certain construction years are significant factors influencing higher resale prices. Properties with larger floor areas (especially above 137 sqm) consistently show the highest average resale prices. Additionally, properties built in the early 2000s, or before 1991, also tend to have higher resale prices, likely due to a combination of space and other property characteristics. Overall, the visual effectively demonstrates that both size and age are key determinants in the resale property market, helping identify which segments are most likely to yield a premium price.

## <a name ="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion

This analysis of the Singapore housing resale market, based on data from 2015 to 2019, reveals several key insights into the factors that influence property resale prices.

Firstly, flat size and type are significant determinants of resale value. Larger flats, such as those with floor areas exceeding 137 square meters, consistently command higher resale prices. Similarly, specific flat models, like "Type S1" and "Type S2," tend to have higher average resale prices compared to others. This indicates a strong preference in the market for spacious living areas and certain flat designs.

Secondly, the storey range also impacts resale prices. Flats situated in higher storey ranges, particularly between levels 37 to 39, tend to sell for more. This may reflect a market preference for better views, more privacy, and potentially lower noise levels associated with higher floors.

Additionally, the age of the property plays a role in determining its resale value. Properties constructed in the early 2000s or before 1991 tend to have higher resale prices. This could be due to a combination of factors such as larger flat sizes typical of older constructions and possibly more desirable locations.

Furthermore, location significantly affects resale prices. Towns like Bukit Merah, Queenstown, and Bishan have higher average resale prices, possibly due to better amenities, proximity to central business areas, or other desirable neighborhood characteristics.

Lastly, the analysis shows a complex relationship between remaining lease years and resale prices. Properties with around 50 years of remaining lease tend to have the highest resale prices, while those with significantly more or fewer years see lower average prices. This suggests that the market values a balance between sufficient lease duration and other property attributes.

Overall, this study highlights the multifaceted nature of property valuation in Singapore's housing resale market. Understanding these factors can help stakeholders make more informed decisions, whether for purchasing, selling, or investing in real estate. While the market remains dynamic and influenced by a variety of factors, focusing on key elements such as flat size, type, storey range, location, and lease years can provide a clearer picture of what drives property value in Singapore.

## <a name ="Limitations"></a>Limitations of the study


Despite having comprehensive data for analyzing resale prices, there are still several limitations in drawing conclusions solely from this dataset. Such factors are:

Data Completeness: The analysis was limited by the dataset, which only covered specific factors like floor area, flat type, storey range, and location. Other influential elements like economic indicators, property condition, and proximity to amenities were not included, which could have provided a more comprehensive view.

Temporal Scope: The dataset spans from 2015 to 2019. Market dynamics could have changed since then, particularly due to recent economic events or new policies.

Model Limitations: Power BI's Key Influencers and Top Segments visuals are limited by the available data and the assumptions inherent in their algorithms, which may not capture all nuances of the real estate market.

Geographic Granularity: The analysis did not consider micro-location factors within towns (e.g., proximity to public transport or green spaces), which can significantly affect resale prices.

Unaccounted Variables: Factors such as property condition, renovations, upcoming developments, and buyer sentiment were not available, limiting the depth of insights regarding property valuations.

Despite these limitations, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing resale prices in Singapore’s housing market. Future studies could benefit from integrating a broader range of data and more sophisticated modeling techniques to capture the complexities of the real estate market fully.
